This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js error handling within asynchronous middleware.  The bug occurs when an error is thrown within an async function in a route handler, and the error is not passed to the next() middleware function.  This prevents Express from properly handling the error and sending a consistent error response. The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle errors in async middleware, using next(err) to propagate the error to Express's error-handling middleware.
